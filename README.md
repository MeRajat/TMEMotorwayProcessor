# TME Motorway Dataset
The “Toyota Motor Europe (TME) Motorway Dataset” is composed by 28 clips for a total of approximately 27 minutes (30000+ frames) with vehicle annotation. Annotation was semi-automatically generated using laser-scanner data. Image sequences were selected from acquisition made in North Italian motorways in December 2011. This selection includes variable traffic situations, number of lanes, road curvature, and lighting, covering most of the conditions present in the complete acquisition.
